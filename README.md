## Hotel Management System

### Abstract :

The aim of an automated hotel management system is to handle all aspects 
of the hotel's information and booking system. This application attempted to 
cover all operations that occur in residential hotels. It is all identified, from 
employee management to booking, floors, offices, and room type 
management, among other things. We sought to demonstrate how 
data/information is processed in hotels in our project, Hotel Management 
System. The hotel management overview was achieved by splitting the 
project into different modules. Customers are offered various facilities such 
as check-in, checkout, and entry editing, payments. Customer Id or customer 
name may be used to search for any customer or employee. It is also 
possible to inquire about available spaces. It will produce reports for 
customers, employees (who work in the hotel), and a bill for the customer 
when the customer checks out. We've only included a few modules because 
our aim is to get an idea or learn more about how hotels are managed. With 
the addition of several more components, this type of project may be used in 
a variety of hotels. The efficiency of any hotel is determined by the method 
used to obtain and prevent information from customers' personal data for 
use in the hotel's various services. It has been a complex and difficult 
operation to manage their outcome revealed, particularly when information 
flow is consistent.
